# RyanLang

##### Warning: RyanLang is in a very crude stage. Also I am also accepting a good name for this language.

Example .rlang file
```
print ( ( 20 + 30 ) * 10 + ( 2 - 65 * 10 ) * 32 )
```

Compiling .rlang file
```sh
$ ./rlang example.rlang
```

### Current Update
- Can print integer
- Can do basic arithmetic
- Limited to 1 line
